# Halftone
Small Java project that creates halftoned images.
Colours are not accurate because of Java bitmap objects, so I've tried to tweak the numbers so it works well in the tests I used.

Here's a sample picture: https://imgur.com/a/rjMpC

The program takes 3 arguments, grid size, input image, output image.
Example usage: Halftone 10 cat.png halftone.png
